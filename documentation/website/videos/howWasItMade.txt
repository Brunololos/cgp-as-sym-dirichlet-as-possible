rotating ASDAP:
The backside vertices of the letters were subject to rotating constraints,
such that the front side vertices also rotate because the optimization tries to conserve the shapes of the letters.
Because this graphic is only meant to "look nice" and show off the ASDAP technique,
we chose to forgo to display which vertices positions are constrained.

ASDAP_(scaling)_spikes:
The top and bottom vertices are constrained and the optimization has been run for about 3h.
The long tail of the optimization has been cut out as nothing visually discernible happened.

ASDAP_spikes:
The top and bottom vertices are constrained and the optimization has been run for about 3h.
The video has been drastically sped up, such that the course of the optimization becomes more visually clear.
